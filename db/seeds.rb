Subject.create({title: "Ruby on Rails", logo: "rails_logo.png", simg: "rails_ss.jpg", summary:"Ruby on Rails (or just “Rails” for short) is a web development framework written in the Ruby programming language. Since its debut, Rails has rapidly become one of the most powerful and popular tools for building dynamic web applications. Rails is used by companies as varied as Airbnb, Disney, GitHub, Shopify, Twitter, and the Yellow Pages. Rails is 100% open-source, available under the generous MIT License, and as a result it also costs nothing to download or use. Rails also owes much of its success to its elegant and compact design. By exploiting the adaptability of the underlying Ruby language, Rails effectively creates a domain-specific language for writing web applications. As a result, many common web programming tasks such as generating HTML, making data models, and routing URLs are easy with Rails, and the resulting application code is concise and readable. Rails is a model–view–controller (MVC) framework, providing default structures for a database, a web service, and web pages.In addition to MVC, Rails emphasises the use of other well-known software engineering patterns and paradigms, including convention over configuration (CoC), don't repeat yourself (DRY), and the active record pattern.

Adding jQuery to Your Web Pages:
To start, copy the script tag in the below image into your html file.

Next, in your js file, you need to add a Document Ready Event. All of your jQuery methods must be inside this as follows:

$(document).ready(function(){
   // jQuery methods go here...
});

Basic Syntax:
The jQuery syntax is tailor-made for selecting HTML elements and performing some action on the element(s).

Basic syntax is: $(selector).action() which is comprised of:

- A $ sign to define/access jQuery
- A (selector) to query (or find) HTML elements
- A jQuery action() to be performed on the element(s)

Topic.create(name: 'Events', content: "jQuery Events and Event Methods:

All the different visitor's actions that a web page can respond to are called DOM events. jQuery is tailor-made to respond to these events.

Examples of DOM events are clicking on an element or moving a mouse over an element (see image for more examples).

The most commonly used is a click event. When a visitor clicks on an element with class 'button', for example, you can assign a click event as follows:
$('.button').click();

We now need to apply a method to the event by adding a function:
$('.button').click(function(){
  // action goes here!!
});

Event methods can be used to manipulate HTML and CSS. See the next topic for more.

Topic.create(name: "Manipulation", content: "DOM, HTML and CSS Manipulation

Now that we know how to select elements and create event listeners, we can apply methods and functions to manipulate the page how we want. Here are some examples:

1. This example targets the CSS of the elements with class 'button', by applying the css() method to the click event. It means when the visitor clicks the element, the background colour of the element will turn blue.

$('.button').click(function(){
  $(this).css('background-color', 'blue');
});

2. The jQuery append() and prepend() methods insert content into selected HTML elements as follows:

$('p').append('Some text appended to the END of a paragraph.');
$('p').prepend('Some text prepended to the BEGINNING of a paragraph.');

3. The following example shows how to add class attributes to different elements, when a button is clicked:

$('button').click(function(){
    $('h1, h2, p').addClass('blue');
    $('div').addClass('important');
});

You could also store shopping cart information or even passwords but that would be a bad idea – you shouldn’t store anything in regular browser cookies that needs to either be secure or persisted across browser sessions. It’s too easy for users to clear their cache and/or steal/manipulate unsecured cookies. To work with cookies, Rails gives you access to a special hash called cookies, where each key-value pair is stored as a separate cookie on the user’s browser. If you were to save cookies[:hair-color] = 'blonde', you’d be able to pull up your browser’s developer tools and see a cookie on the user’s browser that has a key of hair-color and a value of blonde.

Double- and single-quoting have different effects in some cases. A double-quoted string allows character escapes by a leading backslash, and the evaluation of embedded expressions using #{}. A single-quoted string does not do this interpreting; what you see is what you get. Ruby's string handling is smarter and more intuitive than C's.

Arrays can be converted to and from strings, using join and split respectively.

An associative array has elements that are accessed not by sequential index numbers, but by keys which can have any sort of value. Such an array is sometimes called a hash or dictionary; in the ruby world, we prefer the term hash. A hash can be constructed by quoting pairs of items within curly braces ({}). You use a key to find something in a hash, much as you use an index to find something in an array.

Topic.create(name: "Classes", content: "In OO programming terminology, a category of objects like dog is called a class, and some specific object belonging to a class is called an instance of that class. Generally, to make an object in ruby or any other OO language, first one defines the characteristics of a class, then creates an instance. In ruby, a class definition is a region of code between the keywords class and end. A def inside this region begins the definition of a method of the class, which as we discussed in the previous chapter, corresponds to some specific behaviour for objects of that class.

Making a new instance of a class is sometimes called instantiating that class. We need to have a dog before we can experience the pleasure of its conversation; we can't merely ask the Dog class to bark for us. On the other hand, if we want to hear the sound of a dog without getting emotionally attached, we can create (instantiate) an ephemeral, temporary dog, and coax a little noise out of it before it disappears via ruby's automatic garbage collection that decides it is an unwanted stray dog, and mercilessly disposes of it. Really it's okay, you know, because we can make all the dogs we want.

Topic.create(name: "Modules", content: "Modules in ruby are similar to classes, except:

A module can have no instances.
A module can have no subclasses.
A module is defined by module ... end.

There are two typical uses of modules. One is to collect related methods and constants in a central location. The Math module in ruby's standard library plays such a role. The :: operator tells the ruby interpreter which module it should consult for the value of a constant. If we want to refer to the methods or constants of a module directly without using ::, we can include that module.

Another use of modules is called mixin. Some OO programming languages, including C++, allow multiple inheritance, that is, inheritance from more than one superclass. A real-world example of multiple inheritance is an alarm clock; you can think of alarm clocks as belonging to the class of clocks and also the class of things with buzzers. Ruby purposely does not implement true multiple inheritance, but the mixin technique is a good alternative. Remember that modules cannot be instantiated or subclassed; but if we include a module in a class definition, its methods are effectively appended, or mixed in, to the class.

Mixin can be thought of as a way of asking for whatever particular properties we want to have. For example, if a class has a working each method, mixing in the standard library's Enumerable module gives us sort and find methods for free. This use of modules gives us the basic functionality of multiple inheritance but allows us to represent class relationships with a simple tree structure, and so simplifies the language implementation considerably (a similar choice was made by the designers of Java).", timg: "ruby_modules.png", subject_id: "6")

Topic.create(name: "Variables", content: "Ruby has three kinds of variables, one kind of constant and exactly two pseudo-variables. The variables and the constants have no type. While untyped variables have some drawbacks, they have many more advantages and fit well with ruby's quick and easy philosophy. Variables must be declared in most languages in order to specify their type, modifiability (i.e., whether they are constants), and scope; since type is not an issue, and the rest is evident from the variable name as you are about to see, we do not need variable declarations in ruby. '$	- global variable', '@	- instance variable', '[a-z] or _ - local variable', '[A-Z]	- constant'. The only exceptions to the above are ruby's pseudo-variables: self, which always refers to the currently executing object, and nil, which is the meaningless value assigned to uninitialised variables. Both are named as if they are local variables, but self is a global variable maintained by the interpreter, and nil is really a constant. As these are the only two exceptions, they don't confuse things too much." , timg: "", subject_id: "6")

A mixin lets you make groups of CSS declarations that you want to reuse throughout your site. You can even pass in values to make your mixin more flexible. A good use of a mixin is for vendor prefixes. Here's an example for transform. To create a mixin you use the @mixin directive and give it a name. We've named our mixin transform. We're also using the variable $property inside the parentheses so we can pass in a transform of whatever we want.

Topic.create(name: "Pawan Kumar: HANGMAN", content: "Pawan was tasked with creating a web based game using HTML CSS and Javascript. The project was successfully delivered using the Agile approach, which consisted of two sprints carried out over the course of the week. The first sprint objective was to have a Minimum Viable Product(MVP). Pawan's MVP had the basic functionality of hangman working; the user was able to click on an input, the game checked the input with the selected word, the parts of the body were being added to the structure, the game kept track of the number of lives left. During the second sprint, Pawan had the final product ready where the game was fully functional, was styled and also had sound effects. Pawan has demonstrated careful planning, good documenting and development of a web based game utilising his newly gained skills from the previous weeks. Throughout the project, Pawan has demonstrated excellent use of Git and bash technologies which is reflected by his online GitHub repository for this game project.
