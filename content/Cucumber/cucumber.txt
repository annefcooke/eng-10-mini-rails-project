Cucumber
Cucumber is a software tool used by computer programmers for testing other software.
It runs automated acceptance tests written in a behavior-driven development (BDD) style.
Central to the Cucumber BDD approach is its plain language parser called Gherkin. Gherkin is a simple
set of grammar rules that makes plain text structured enough for Cucumber to understand. The scenario above
is written in Gherkin.

source "https://rubygems.org"

group :test do
  gem 'cucumber', '~> 3.1.0'
  gem 'rspec', '~> 3.7.0'
end
Install Cucumber and prepare the file structure:

bundle install
cucumber --init
You now have a simple project with Cucumber installed.


gherkin layout topic:
Cucumber tests usually come in the form:
Scenario: Sunday is not Friday
    Given today is Sunday
    When I ask whether it's Friday yet
    Then I should be told "Nope"

step defs topic:
Once a test is wireframed out you can fill in the appropriate methods
Given("today is Friday") do
  @today = Friday
end

When("I ask whether it's Friday yet") do
  @actual_answer = is_it_friday(@today)
end

Then("I should be told Yeah") do
  expect(@actual_answer).to eq("Yeah")
end
